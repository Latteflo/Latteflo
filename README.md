Hi there 👋

I'm Flo, a <strong>software developer</strong> with a background in aviation and a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications. 
I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

In my free time, I enjoy 🏊‍♀️ swimming, traveling, and trying out new coffee shops (hence the username "latteflo"). I am also an avid reader and enjoy learning about new technologies and trends in the software development industry.

Feel free to check out my projects and contributions on GitHub. I am always open to feedback and collaboration, so don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:sf.simion.f@gmail.com">reach out</a>! 📩

Thanks for visiting my profile.

Flo 🙋‍♀️
